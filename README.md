## Run it your self

If you want to test the code, run the following commands

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
```

## Template

Creating a new src, test and data file for a day is automated. To create a new set run call `yarn new <day>`, day is optional if not provided the next day will be loaded based on previously generated files. Example:

```
yarn new 2
```

If you provide the AdventOfCode session cookie in a `.env` file your daily puzzle input will automatically be populated.

Example:

```
session=53616c7...
```
